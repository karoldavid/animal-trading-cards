			<p>Snow leopards live in the mountains of Central Asia. These rare, beautiful gray leopards are insulated by thick hair, and their wide, fur-covered feet act as natural snowshoes. They use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill.</p>
